Open-Source Robotics for Children Education around Oilfield Operations

This a new purpose for the SPE's International Program known as Energy4me. This project is based on an Open-Source Robotic initiative which started at 2013 and has been adapted along the years to different versions according to many developers. This work aims to promote knowledge-learning about technology and digitization in schools where oilfield operations generate positive impact. Energy4me prompts children to learn about energy industry, therefore, the Ecuador Section considered fundamental to include within this scope a game changer topic of the last decades which is Open-Source Robotics, 3D-Pritining and programming.
