# TiTi
Open-Source Robotics for Children Education in Oilfield Operations Areas.

This a new purpose for the SPE's International Program known as Energy4me. This project is based on an Open-Source Robotic initiative which started at 2013 and has been adapted along the years to different versions according to many developers. 
Energy4me prompts children to learn about energy industry, therefore, the Ecuador Section considered fundamental to include within this scope a game changer topic of the last decades which is Open-Source Technologies and Robotics, 3D-Pritining and Programming. 
This time, this work aims to promote knowledge-learning about technology and digitization in schools where oilfield operations generate positive impact. 

## Source-Code
TiTi Source-Code belongs to the time-line development variations of the ***open-source project*** **BoB
#bobthebiped**, which started in 2013 by Kevin Biagini. [BoB](https://www.personalrobots.biz/bob-the-biped-robot/) [BoB](https://www.thingiverse.com/k120189/designs)

Next variations and improvements of the former version were performed by different authors and teams, the 
most disruptive in terms of innovation was Zowi, created originally by Javier Isabel Hernandez, [Zowi](https://github.com/JavierIH/zowi), 
which included the Oscillator library from [ArduSnake](https://github.com/Obijuan/ArduSnake/tree/master/ArduSnake)
developed by Juan Gonzalez-Gomez (Obijuan) in 2011. This library is meant to Generate sinusoidal oscillations in the servos which achieved a better locomotion of the robot due to a better harmonic synchronization.


Finally, the most profitable and well-known version of these sequence of biped robots is the Otto-DIY, [Otto](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY/otto-diy), which by its own reference is the most refined version of the Bob. 

All of these versions contributed with a different scope of wide-used project started a long time ago with the same purpose, share knowledge about technology to anyone. 

For us, we decided to use all of this legacy to drive an initiative focused on **children who live close** to the ***Oilfield operations in Ecuador***, all of the variations, adaptations and contributions are released under the same license, and they're available to any contributor and developer who may want to use it 
for the same purpose.
