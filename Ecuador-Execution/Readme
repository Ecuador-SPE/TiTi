#Ecuador Execution Program

We're committed to challenge of balancing the planet, closing the educational gap and a better quality of life in Amazonian communities in Ecuador. 
For this reason, by means of the #Energy4me program, we carry out robotics workshops aimed at children and young people from 4 educational institutions 
belonging to the communities who live close to the oilfield operations in Ecuador.

Orellana Province:
 - Unidad Educativa of the Millennium "Amazonas" 
 - Educational Unit "David Clark")
 
Sucumbios Province:

 - Educational Unit Teniente Coronel "Lauro Guerrero")

With the support of 20 volunteers from the SPE and SLB, a total of 1,363 students were trained in robotics and basic programming.
